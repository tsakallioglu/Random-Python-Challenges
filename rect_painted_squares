#magine a white rectangular grid of n rows and m columns divided into two parts by a diagonal line running from the upper left to the lower right corner. Now let's paint the grid in two colors according to the following rules:
#A cell is painted black if it has at least one point in common with the diagonal;
#Otherwise, a cell is painted white.
#Count the number of cells painted black.

from fractions import gcd
def countBlackCells(n, m):
    return max(m,n) + (min(m,n)-1) + (gcd(m,n)-1)
